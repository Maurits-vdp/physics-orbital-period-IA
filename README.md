# physics-orbital-period-IA
This is a short bit of code I worked on, including the raw data generated (in the form of the csv file), used for my physics IA.
Please note that some data was stored in loggerpro instead of csv files. I did this for the sake of not making any mistakes when transferring data.

Furthermore please consider that some numerical constants may vary slightly compared to the IA, in such a case the actual value used was the one listed in the essay.
